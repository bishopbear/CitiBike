Overview of the analysis: The purpose of our analysis is to show the opportunities of providing a bike service in Des Moines, Iowa. We have analyzed data from another city and we have prepared visuals to show our findings.

Results:
Top Starting Lcoations

These first two visuals show the top start and stop locations. As we have shown here, there is considerable overlap. This overlap is seen as a strong positive in that it is easier for our users to find bikes since the usage starts and stops in roughly the same area.
Top Ending Locations

We can see here that males are our main riders.

Trip Duration Summary

This helps us understand that the service is almost entirely used for short duration trips.

Who is using the service?

We can see here that approx. 75% of users are males.

Trips by Weekday per hour

This visual helps understand a few important aspects of our service. We can see that our heavy usage times correlate with users going to work M-F. We can also see that there is steady usage during the weekend days. One point of interest that this visual shows is that during the hours of 12 am to 4 am there is very light usage. This window of time is when we suggest that the bikes be serviced.

Trips by Gender

This last visual helps us to see that primarily men are the main users of our service.

Summary:
Our initial analysis is encouraging. We clearly see that this service works.
Our three main findings are:
- Males are our main users and should be our target market.
- Heavy usage times follow overall trends of going to and from work on weekdays.
- We can see clearly that the window from 12AM to 4AM is the lowest usage time and should be used to service the bikes.

To take our analysis further we could find usage per age and usage per start/end station.
